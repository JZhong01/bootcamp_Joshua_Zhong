# Stakeholder Memo

The portfolio management team relies heavily on the movements of Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Alphabet, and Amazon, which collectively represent ~25% of the U.S. equity market. Our current strategies are backward-looking, and we lack predictive tools to anticipate price shifts in these mega-cap stocks. To address this, we propose building a machine learningâ€“based forecasting model using historical Yahoo Finance data. The model will generate daily price forecasts with confidence intervals, providing actionable insights for timing trades, managing concentration risk, and improving risk-adjusted returns.
